# Moving Picture Studio

![]("http://mps.olekolek1000.pl/github/logo.png">)

**[MAIN WEBPAGE](http://mps.olekolek1000.pl/)**

This is a stop-motion animation program which is made to be **MODERN**, **EASY**, **MULTIPLATFORM** and **FAST**.

![img_screenshot](http://mps.olekolek1000.pl/github/screenshot.png)

The application is written in C++, based on OpenGL 2.1/ES 2.0 and SDL.  
Currently supported/tested platforms:  

 - Linux x64
 - Windows x64
 
Works, but it's unstable:
 - MacOS x64

This application also works on ARM processors (Raspberry Pi and other).  
	
Please report any bugs and problems in this program. It helps a lot!
Ideas are also welcome ;)
