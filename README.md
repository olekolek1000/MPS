===Moving Picture Studio===

This is a stop-motion animation program which is made to be <b>MODERN</b>, <b>EASY</b>, <b>MULTIPLATFORM</b> and <b>FAST</b>.
This project is currently under HEAVY DEVELOPMENT.

The application is based on OpenGL 2.1 and SDL library.

Current supported platforms:
	-Linux x64  (./MPS)
	-Windows x86  (MPS.exe)
	
Please report any bugs and problems in this program. It helps a lot!
The ideas are also welcome ;)
